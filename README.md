# heartBot
A discord bot developed for a gaming group, designed to track and manage monetary donations between two users. 
This was developed by me and two other users. I worked primarily on the functions in heart.py and the discord commands. My two partners also worked on the discord commands.
As this bot was originally designed for a Chinese gaming group, one of my partners wrote many of the commands in Mandarin. Working and coordinating with them was a great experience.
